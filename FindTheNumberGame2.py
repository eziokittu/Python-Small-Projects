    ----- Find the number Game - II -----
    --- Rules of game ---
    1 - The program generates a random number
    2 - and prompts the user to guess the number
    3 - if the user's guess is below the random number, the random number is divided by 2 else multiplied by 2
    4 - the game ends if the user guesses the exact number
    5 - the number of tries is given as score
    --- Some other parts of this program ---
    1 - after each game ends the score is saved in a text file.
    2 - before starting the game, the user has option to choose the starting and ending numbers and see high scores
    3 - after dividing the secret number if that number becomes float say 6.5 it will become 6
